# Cryptography-Project

Prompt
You have been recruited as an analyst to a secret intelligence agency, this agency is so secret that we can’t even tell you its name. As an analyst, agents are relying on you to be able to encrypt and decrypt messages they find on missions. To save some time you want to write a program that will help cover some of the more common Cipher Algorithms.

Assignment
Create a program that will allow a user to choose between two of the cipher algorithms we looked at in class (Caesar and AtBash). Then the user will tell you if they are trying to encrypt/encode or decrypt/decode a message. They will also need to select a key for Caesar shift if that was the option they chose. After performing an encryption or decryption the user should be prompted to perform another action or quit the program.

Suggested Steps/Base Requirements:
You must have an encryption and decryption option for Caesar and AtBash; note that the logic for AtBash decryption and encryption is the same
Your program should be able to handle an all lowercase message with spaces (no punctuation). Remember that spaces are not encoded or decoded
Focus on one method at a time before putting it all together, start with the encryption then the decryption
Start by making sure the method can translate one word at a time, then try translating an entire phrase
A good way to test your methods is to encrypt a message then decrypt the result

Challenges (Optional, potential EC):
Make your program print case sensitive message, (“Password” becomes “Qbttxpse” in a shift 1 Caesar)
If a user enters punctuation into their message then you should return the punctuation unchanged (“Computer... Science!” becomes “Dpnqvufs... Tdjfodf!”)  
Allow the user to access and use their previous message in the next encryption/decryption
Implement other cipher algorithms that you think could be included in this program such as create an anagram of the word (encryption only), ROT-13 Cipher, etc
Double Encryption, run a message through two different ciphers

Though we will still be working with peers for this project, this is to be your own work.
This project is to display the skills you have developed over the course of the year so far. Refer to the Student Handbook under “Academic Integrity” for additional information.



Baseline Requirements
Total:   /5
Logic
The project can access all 4 options of encryption and decryption (see individual components). Also gives the user the option to continue running the program multiple times
 /3
Formatting
Statements are easy to read and flow well. White space, comments, headers, and indentation are used to make the code clearer
